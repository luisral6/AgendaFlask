## Advantages and disadvantages of the programming language.

### Advantages
- Simplicity. One of the easiest programming languages to learn.
- Extensive support libraries.

### Disadvantages
- As an interpreted language it has a slower speed of execution.
- The bugs only appear during run time.
- Underdeveloped database access layers. When compared with Java, for example, with JDBC.

## Advantages and disadvantages of the web application framework/stack.

### Advantages
- Small core and easily extensible
- Easy URL routing.

### Disadvantages
- No database abstraction layer.
- Not asynchronous friendly.

## Most common technologies used with the platform/framework

- SQLalchemy: A toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
- PIP: A packaging manager for Python.

## Most popular IDEs

- PyCharm: A paid IDE developed by JetBrains. Very robust and with a lot of features.
- IDLE: The minimal IDE for developing python. It is a free IDE.
- Atom: Facilitates pretty much everything, it describes itself as a "hackable" IDE.
- Sublime Text: It's like the swiss army of IDEs.
